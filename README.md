<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. Decide how you want to use the snippets/code. 
  1. As a snippet
  2. As a copy and paste


<h3> Setting up snippets </h2>
I'm on Atom, which uses a snippets.cson file. I don't know coffeescript, but I do know that the below is the basis for setting up a new snippet. 

Go to Atom ---> Snippets and insert the below

```
.source.js':
  'HR Assessment Helpers':
    'prefix': 'mintaser'
    'body': '''
    //Thing to be inserted
    '''
```
Edit ```mintaser``` if you prefer a different keyword.

I've included two versions of the snippet, a full version and the minified version. Use the version that you are most comfortable with. 

<h3> Describe and test </h2>
These are not underscore functions, I made them up.
